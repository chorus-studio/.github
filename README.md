Enhance Spotify with controls to save favourite track section and auto-skip. Save sections can be used for infinite looping of a chorus, verse, etc. Snips can be shared with others. Auto-skip tracks in a playlists or albums and never hear them again. Additionally set global playback speed and per track speed! More features to come!

⭐ 💡 Toggling the entire extension on/off by clicking the extension icon in the toolbar. Toggle the extension off whenever you want to listen to Spotify without your snips, blocked songs, or custom playback speeds and pitch. Toggle it back on to enjoy the features. It would be a good idea to have the extension pinned for quick access and use of this feature.

⭐ ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts. The core functionality of the extension can be triggered via keypress. Additional media commands such as play/pause, shuffle, mute/unmute, etc are also available. Reference ["Setting Browser Keyboard Shortcuts"](https://www.makeuseof.com/open-browser-extensions-keyboard-shortcut/) for your specific browser.

## 📆 **Upcoming Features** 📆

✂️ Multi-Snips. More snips in a track. For example, snips to only play a chorus and the second verse of a track.

💿 Discography. Keep track of your progress as you work through an artist's discography and resume where you left off.

📓 Review. View your favourite snips and blocked songs. Some filtering.

### 🎀 **V2** 🎀

📱 Web App. This will likely just be a simple UI utilizing Spotify Connect to apply the above features/controls, but areas like search, playlist creation, music discovery will left to the official Spotify App.

## ⚙️ **Releases** ⚙️

Releases are automated based on semantic releases and tagged as such in the [Releases](https://github.com/chorus-studio/chorus/releases) page. Releases have the newest features, bug fixes, etc, but the Web Store / Addons versions are most likely a day or two behind due to Chrome/Mozilla review cycle. If you want the latest and greatest, the download the `chorus-chrome.zip` or `chorus-firefox.zip` file from the newest release.

## 👋 **Closing Remarks** 👋

For issues, questions, feature suggestions, etc please report it [here](https://github.com/chorus-studio/chorus-dev/issues/new/choose).

[Kofi Page](https://ko-fi.com/cdrani) for those appreciative. No obligation - in fact I might take it as an offence. This project is about adding some missing features in Spotify that I deem might warrant the price hikes. Just giving it a :star: here and review/rating on the Web Store is sufficient for me to keep adding features, fixing bugs, and maintaining it. Thanks!
